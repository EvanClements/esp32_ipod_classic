# This is the list of jobs that will be run concurrently.
# Since we use a build matrix, the actual number of jobs
# started depends on how many configurations the matrix
# will produce.
jobs:
  # This is the name of the job - can be whatever.
  test-matrix:

    # Here we tell GitHub that the jobs must be determined
    # dynamically depending on a matrix configuration.
    # strategy:
      # matrix:
        # The matrix will produce one job for each configuration
        # parameter of type `arduino-platform`, in this case a
        # total of 2.
        # arduino-platform: ["espressif:esp32"]
        # This is usually optional but we need to statically define the
        # FQBN of the boards we want to test for each platform. In the
        # future the CLI might automatically detect and download the core
        # needed to compile against a certain FQBN, at that point the
        # following `include` section will be useless.
        # include:
          # This works like this: when the platform is "espressif:esp32", the
          # variable `fqbn` is set to "espressif:esp32:esp32".
          # - arduino-platform: "espressif:esp32"
            # fqbn: "espressif:esp32:esp32"

    # This is the platform GitHub will use to run our workflow, we
    # pick Windows for no particular reason.
